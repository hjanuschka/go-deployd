## Development Guidelines

### Adding New Features

1. **Create an issue first** to discuss the feature
2. **Keep changes focused** - one feature per PR
3. **Add tests** for new functionality
4. **Update documentation** as needed
5. **Consider backward compatibility**

### Bug Fixes

1. **Reproduce the bug** with a test case
2. **Fix the issue** with minimal changes
3. **Verify the fix** doesn't break existing functionality
4. **Add regression tests** if possible

### Testing

#### Running Tests
```bash
# All tests
make test

# Specific package
go test ./internal/database/...

# With coverage
make test-coverage
```

#### Writing Tests
- Use table-driven tests for multiple test cases
- Mock external dependencies
- Test both success and error cases
- Include integration tests for complex features

### Database Changes

When modifying database functionality:
- Test with SQLite, MySQL, and MongoDB
- Ensure backward compatibility
- Update migration logic if needed
- Document any schema changes

### Event System Changes

When modifying the event system:
- Test both JavaScript and Go events
- Ensure hot-reload works correctly
- Update event documentation
- Test with different collection configurations

## Documentation

### API Documentation
