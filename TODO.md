- next up would be in the admin dashboard allow per checkbox to skip events when editing documents 
- make sure we have createdAt und updatedAt on each collection, dont let users remove it, and make sure that on creation/update it is set correctly, this also should be not overrideable via the events
- show updatedAt also in table of docs in dashboard
